The Cohere API is based on Large Language Models (LLMs), similar to OpenAI's models, but developed and trained by Cohere,
   a company focused on providing NLP tools for enterprises and developers.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the Cohere API is based on:
1.Cohere's models are primarily based on Transformer architectures, 
   the same foundational architecture used in models like GPT (from OpenAI) and BERT (from Google).
2.Their most well-known model family is called Command R, 
   optimized for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning tasks.
